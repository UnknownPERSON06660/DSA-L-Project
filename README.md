**Binary Search**

Binary search is a fast way to find a number in a list. (The list must be sorted)
In the he following code we perform a binary search in a list, if the value is found it will return the value or else it will return ‚Äì1.

Following is the breakdown of the code:

I.	In first step, we define the function named binary search. It takes 2 parameters as input arr(array) & t(target value).

II.	Then we initialize 2 variables l(left) and r(right) whose values are 0 and length of array, respectively.

III.	In third step, we created a while loop to search the value in the array. The loop will run until the value of l is smaller or equal to value of r.

IV.	In next step, we created a variable named mid which and the value equals to the middle of the list. We did this so we can easily divide the list into half.

V.	Then I use if condition to check if the number at the middle matches the target value or not. If the number matches the search will end here.

VI.	In next step I used a formula to adjust the value of search range. If the middle value is less than the target value, it means the target value is on the right part of the list, so we move to right. And if the middle value is greater than the target value, then it means that target must be in the left part of the list.

VII.	At the end of the function we return ‚Äì1, it executes only if the while loop can‚Äôt find the value.

VIII.	At the end of the program, I initialize a list in n variable and the target value in t variable. After that I call the function by passing the n and t variable         in it. And then it will check if the returned value is not equals to ‚Äì1 it will tell the index of the value or else it will say value not found.

**Linear Search**

Linear search is a simple method to find a number in a list.
In the following code, we perform a linear search in a list. If the value is found, it will return the index of the value; otherwise, it will return -1.

Following is the breakdown of the code:

I. In the first step, we define a function named linear_search. It takes two parameters as input: arr (the array) and t (the target value).

II. Inside the function, we use a for loop to go through each element in the list one by one.
    The enumerate function is used to get both the index (i) and the value (v) of each element in the list.

III. For each element in the list, we use an if condition to check if the current value (v) matches the target value (t).
        If the value matches, the function immediately returns the index (i) where the target value is found.

IV. If the loop completes without finding the target value, the function returns -1.
This indicates that the target value is not in the array.

V. At the end of the program, we initialize a list in the n variable and the target value in the t variable.
    We then call the linear_search function by passing n and t as arguments.
    The result is stored in the variable r.
        If r is not -1, it means the target value is found, and we print its index.
        Otherwise, we print "Target not found."

üöÄ How to Run the Program
Prerequisites
    Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Steps to Run the Program

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Project Directory

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Program
Ensure Python is properly installed, then execute the script.
Program Execution

The program performs a test run with:
    A predefined list of elements.
    A target value to search for.

It utilizes both Linear Search and Binary Search to find the target and:
    Returns the index of the target element, if found.
    Indicates if the target is not found in the list.

Purpose of the Code

This project demonstrates the implementation of:
üîç Linear Search: A simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in the list until the target is found.

‚ö° Binary Search: A highly efficient search algorithm for sorted lists, which repeatedly divides the list into halves to locate the target.
Key Learnings

‚úÖ Algorithmic Efficiency:
    Linear Search: O(n) time complexity, as it scans every element.
    Binary Search: O(log n) time complexity, as it reduces the search space logarithmically.

‚úÖ Binary Search Caveat:
    It works only with sorted data. Applying it to unsorted lists can yield incorrect results or require preprocessing (sorting), which adds overhead.

‚úÖ Importance of Real-World Applications:
    Understanding when and where to use specific algorithms is crucial for optimizing performance in practical scenarios.

Time Complexity Breakdown

1Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Search:
    Worst-Case Scenario: When the target is at the last position or doesn‚Äôt exist in the list, Linear Search examines all n elements: O(n).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search:
    Best Case: Finds the target quickly within O(1) comparisons (target is in the middle).
    Worst Case: For a list of size n, it requires O(log n) comparisons to narrow down the search space to a single element.

Note: Applying Binary Search to an unsorted list degrades its efficiency to O(n), equivalent to Linear Search, because the entire list may need to be examined sequentially.
